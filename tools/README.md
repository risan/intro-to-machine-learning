## Using Modules in Tools Directory

Many of the modules here are used by the other modules outside this `tool` directory.
To import and use these modules outside of the `tool` directory, we need to use `sys.path.append` first:

```py
import sys
sys.path.append("/path/to/tools")

from terrain_data_generator import generate_terrain_data
```

## The Startup Script

The `startup.py` script will check if all the required packages are installed. It will also download the Enron dataset.

```shell
$ python tools/startup.py
```

### Modules Checker

The `modules_checker.py` is a module that you can use to check if the given module names are installed.

```py
from modules_checker import check_modules

check_modules(["nltk", "numpy", "scipy", "sklearn", "matplotlib])
```

If all the given modules are installed, you'll get the output similar to this:

```shell
✅ nltk is installed.
✅ numpy is installed.
✅ scipy is installed.
✅ sklearn is installed.
✅ matplotlib is installed.
```

If one of the given modules are not available, it will stop the script execution.

```shell
✅ nltk is installed.
❌ Please install numpy first.
```

### Enron Dataset Downloader

The `enron_dataset_downloader.py` is a module that we can use to download the Enron dataset:

```py
from enron_dataset_downloader import download_enron_dataset

# Pass the absolute path to the directory where you want to store the dataset to.
download_enron_dataset("/path/to/data_directory")
```

## Terrain Classifier Helpers

### Terrain Data Generator

The `terrain_data_generator.py` is used to generate a random terrain data. It accepts the optional `total_points` parameter, which determines the total number of points that needs to be generated (default to `1000`).

```py
from terrain_data_generator import generate_terrain_data

features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = generate_terrain_data(total_points = 1000)
```

### Predict and Plot

The `plot.py` module is used to run the classifier and plot the prediction result.

```py
from plot import predict_and_plot

predict_and_plot(classifier, features_test, labels_test, image_path)
```

* `classifier`: It's an instance of the trained classifier.
* `features_test`: The features test to predict.
* `labels_test`: The actual output labels.
* `iamge_path`: The optional image path, pass this parameter if you want to save the plot as an image too.

## Email Classifier Helpers

### Email Pre-processor

The `email_pre_processor.py` is used to split the emails data for training and testing. It will also vectorized the words into list of numbers and select only 10% of features with the highest score.

```py
from email_pre_processor import pre_process_email

features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = pre_process_email()
```

It accepts two optional parameters:

- `texts_file`: The path to the email text list file.
- `authors_file`: The path to the email author list file.

### Timer

The `timer.py` contain a `Timer` class with two static methods to count the time:

```py
from timer import Timer

Timer.start()
# Do some thing here
Timer.stop("Time: ") # Time: 1.234s
```
